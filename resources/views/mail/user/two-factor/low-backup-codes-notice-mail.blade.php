# Low Backup Codes Alert: Action Required

Hey {{ $user->first_name }},

We've noticed that you have very few backup codes remaining for your account. This situation requires your immediate attention to ensure uninterrupted access to your account.

Why this matters:
Backup codes are crucial for regaining access to your account if you lose your primary two-factor authentication method. Having an adequate supply of these codes is essential for maintaining the security and accessibility of your account.

Recommended action:
Generate a new set of 10 backup codes immediately. This will ensure you have enough codes for future use.

After generating new codes:
1. Store them securely in a password manager or a safe physical location.
2. Delete any previously used or potentially compromised codes.
3. Consider setting up an additional two-factor authentication method for added security.

Stay secure,<br>
