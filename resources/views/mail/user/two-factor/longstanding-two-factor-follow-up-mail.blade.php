# Annual Backup Codes Review

Hey {{ $user->first_name }},

It's been a year since you last generated your account backup codes. To ensure the continued security of your account, we recommend reviewing and potentially updating these codes.

Key points to consider:

1. Verify that you still have access to your backup codes.
2. Check if you've used any codes in the past year.
3. Ensure your codes are stored in a secure location.

If you can't locate your codes or have used some, it's time to generate a new set.

Remember, backup codes are crucial for account recovery if you lose access to your primary two-factor authentication method. Keeping them up-to-date and secure is an important part of maintaining your account's safety.


Stay secure,<br>
